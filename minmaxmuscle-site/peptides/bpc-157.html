BPC-157 has been studied primarily in laboratory animals for its potential healing properties. Research suggests it may help repair damaged tissues by promoting new blood vessel growth and activating various cellular repair pathways. In animal studies, the compound has shown promise for healing injuries to tendons, ligaments, muscles, and bones, as well as protecting organs and blood vessels from damage. It may also have neuroprotective effects on the brain and nervous system. Despite these findings in preclinical research, BPC-157 is not approved by any drug regulatory agency for human use, and there is limited data regarding it effectiveness on humans, although it has been used for many years. The peptide has gained popularity among athletes and the general public for injury recovery, leading the World Anti-Doping Agency to ban it in 2022. Health authorities discourage its use due to insufficient human safety data, and some jurisdictions have restricted it as a prescription-only medicine despite it not being available through legitimate prescriptions. Additionally, because the compound promotes blood vessel formation ( angiogenesis ), there are theoretical concerns about potential cancer promotion that require further investigation.</li><li>The peptide was discovered during research on human gastric juice. [ 1 ] The amino acid sequence is Gly - Glu - Pro -Pro-Pro-Gly- Lys -Pro- Ala - Asp -Asp-Ala-Gly- Leu - Val . [ 2 ] BPC-157 is stable at room temperature and bioavailable in rodent models when administered IM or IV . [ 3 ] The peptide demonstrates remarkable stability in human gastric juice, remaining intact for more than 24 hours, which supports its therapeutic effectiveness when administered orally. [ 4 ]</li><li># Pharmacology</li><li># Mechanism of Action</li><li>BPC-157 works through several interconnected biological pathways that promote healing and tissue repair. To understand how it functions, it is helpful to think of the peptide as a chemical messenger that activates various repair mechanisms in the body.</li><li>The primary way BPC-157 promotes healing is by activating the VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2) pathway. [ 5 ] VEGF (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor) is a protein that signals the body to create new blood vessels—a process called angiogenesis . Blood vessels function as the transportation network that delivers oxygen, nutrients, and repair materials to damaged tissues. Without adequate blood supply, injured tissues cannot heal properly.</li><li>When BPC-157 binds to VEGFR2 receptors on the surface of endothelial cells (the cells that line blood vessels), it triggers a cascade of events. The receptor becomes phosphorylated—meaning phosphate molecules attach to it, activating it like flipping a switch. This activation then triggers the Akt-eNOS pathway, which increases production of nitric oxide (NO) in the blood vessel walls. [ 6 ] Nitric oxide causes blood vessels to dilate (widen), improving blood flow to injured areas and allowing more oxygen and healing nutrients to reach damaged tissues.</li><li>BPC-157 activates several other molecular pathways that work together to promote tissue repair. [ 7 ]</li><li>Focal adhesion kinase (FAK)-paxillin complexes are activated, which help cells migrate and attach to surfaces. This is crucial for wound healing because cells need to move into damaged areas and anchor themselves to begin rebuilding tissue. The peptide stimulates JAK-2 ( Janus kinase 2), a protein that relays signals from outside the cell to the nucleus where genes are activated. This signaling pathway is involved in cell survival, growth, and immune responses—all essential for healing.</li><li>Early Growth Response gene 1 (Egr-1) is also activated. This gene acts like a master switch that turns on many other genes involved in cell growth, survival, and blood vessel formation. When Egr-1 is upregulated, it signals cells to grow and repair. The extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK1/2) pathway becomes activated as well. This pathway controls cell division and survival. When tissues are damaged, new cells must divide to replace dead or injured ones, and ERK1/2 activation promotes this cell multiplication.</li><li>BPC-157 changes which genes are expressed in cells, particularly in brain tissue after injury. [ 8 ] When genes are upregulated (increased), specific biological effects occur:</li><li>Vegfr2 upregulation produces more VEGF receptors, making cells more sensitive to growth signals and better able to form new blood vessels. Nos3 and Nos1 genes produce enzymes that make nitric oxide, which dilates blood vessels and improves blood flow. Akt1 promotes cell survival and prevents damaged cells from dying prematurely, giving them time to repair. Src helps cells communicate with each other and respond to growth signals. Kras is involved in cell growth and division—essential for replacing damaged cells. Foxo and Srf are transcription factors that regulate many genes involved in stress resistance, metabolism, and cell survival.</li><li>BPC-157 downregulates (decreases) certain genes that can be harmful during healing. Nos2 produces large amounts of nitric oxide during inflammation, which can damage tissues if overproduced. By reducing Nos2, BPC-157 may help control excessive inflammation. Nfkb (Nuclear Factor kappa B) is a major inflammation-promoting factor. While some inflammation is necessary for healing, excessive amounts can cause additional tissue damage. By downregulating Nfkb, BPC-157 may reduce harmful inflammatory responses.</li><li>BPC-157 modulates Src and caveolin -1 (Cav-1) phosphorylation. [ 6 ] Caveolin-1 is a protein found in small pockets (caveolae) on the cell membrane. When BPC-157 affects these proteins, it changes how VEGFR2 receptors are internalized into cells and how endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) is activated. The result is sustained production of nitric oxide, which keeps blood vessels dilated and ensures continuous blood flow to healing tissues.</li><li>These mechanisms work together to create an optimal environment for tissue repair. BPC-157 increases blood flow to damaged areas, promotes new blood vessel formation, encourages cell survival and growth, facilitates cell migration to injury sites, and balances inflammatory responses to prevent excessive tissue damage while still allowing necessary healing inflammation.</li><li># Dosage and Administration</li><li>In research settings, typical dosages of BPC-157 range from 200 to 500 micrograms (mcg) daily. Preclinical studies commonly employ doses of 10 micrograms per kilogram (μg/kg) or 10 nanograms per kilogram (ng/kg) body weight administered once or twice daily. The peptide can be administered through various routes including intraperitoneal injection, subcutaneous injection, intramuscular injection, intravenous infusion, or oral administration. [ 3 ] The half-life following intramuscular or intravenous administration is less than 30 minutes, indicating rapid clearance from circulation. [ 3 ]</li><li>A 2025 pilot study in humans evaluated intravenous infusion of BPC-157 at doses of 10 mg and 20 mg in two adults, demonstrating no adverse effects on cardiac, hepatic, renal, thyroid, or glucose biomarkers, with the peptide being well-tolerated. [ 9 ]</li><li># Research</li><li>Pre-clinical research has indicated that BPC-157 may have cytoprotective, neuroprotective, and anti-inflammatory effects, and may also accelerate tissue and organ healing. [ 8 ] [ 10 ] [ 11 ] [ 4 ] [ 12 ] [ 13 ]</li><li># Vascular and Organ Protection</li><li>Research has demonstrated that BPC-157 can counteract vessel occlusion syndromes by rapidly activating collateral blood vessel pathways, effectively bypassing occluded or damaged vessels. [ 14 ] Studies in rat models have shown effectiveness in treating complications from occlusion of major vessels including the superior mesenteric artery and vein, as well as therapeutic effects in models of glaucoma induced by episcleral vein cauterization. [ 15 ]</li><li># Musculoskeletal and Neurological Applications</li><li>BPC-157 has demonstrated beneficial effects in various musculoskeletal injury models, including tendon ruptures, ligament tears, muscle detachment, and bone healing. [ 16 ] The peptide has shown neuroprotective properties in models of traumatic brain injury, spinal cord compression, and peripheral nerve transection. [ 17 ] Animal studies have documented effects on neurotransmitter systems, particularly serotonergic and dopaminergic pathways. [ 7 ]</li><li>This substance is sometimes used in functional medicine despite not being approved by any drug regulatory agency. [ 7 ] The compound promotes angiogenesis and as a result has some concerns over cancer promotion. [ 18 ]</li><li>As of 2022, the peptide has been banned by the World Anti-Doping Agency under the S0 category of non-exempt substances. [ 19 ] [ 20 ]</li><li>BPC-157 has been widely used both by athletes and among the general public, mainly for recovery from injury or stimulating healing in chronic conditions, [ 21 ] [ 22 ] [ 16 ] [ 23 ] but there is as yet only very limited human trial data on efficacy and only a few preliminary safety studies, [ 24 ] [ 25 ] [ 26 ] so use of BPC-157 is discouraged by health authorities and it has been controlled as a prescription medicine in several jurisdictions such as New Zealand and Australia, despite not actually being available for prescription. [ 27 ] [ 28 ]</li><li># Detection</li><li>BPC-157 is detected in urine using a weak cation exchange solid phase extraction and was found to be stable in urine for 4 days.

However, the underlying mechanism has not been fully clarified. The present study aimed to explore the effect of BPC 157 on tendon fibroblasts isolated from Achilles tendon of male Sprague-Dawley rat. From the result of cDNA microarray analysis, growth hormone receptor was revealed as one of the most abundantly up-regulated genes in tendon fibroblasts by BPC 157. BPC 157 dose- and time-dependently increased the expression of growth hormone receptor in tendon fibroblasts at both the mRNA and protein levels as measured by RT/real-time PCR and Western blot, respectively. The addition of growth hormone to BPC 157-treated tendon fibroblasts dose- and time-dependently increased the cell proliferation as determined by MTT assay and PCNA expression by RT/real-time PCR. Janus kinase 2, the downstream signal pathway of growth hormone receptor, was activated time-dependently by stimulating the BPC 157-treated tendon fibroblasts with growth hormone. In conclusion, the BPC 157-induced increase of growth hormone receptor in tendon fibroblasts may potentiate the proliferation-promoting effect of growth hormone and contribute to the healing of tendon.</li><li>Keywords: BPC 157, growth hormone receptor, proliferation, PCNA, tendon fibroblast</li><li># 1. Introduction</li><li>Tendon injury is one of the most frequent injuries in sport activities. Most tendon injuries are resulted from a tear of tendon fibers due to overuse, aging or accident. The healing of a ruptured tendon is known to be difficult and the repair of completely torn tendon is, therefore, often relies on surgery. Tendon is composed of cells (tendon fibroblasts) and extracellular matrix, which contains mostly type I collagen, type III collagen and glycoproteins. The process of tendon healing is classified into three stages: inflammation, regeneration, and remodeling. In the regeneration stage, tendon fibroblasts migrate into the injured site, proliferate and produce different types of collagens and glycoproteins to form the extracellular matrix. The whole process takes a long time to complete and the healed tendon is always weaker than the tendon before injury [ 1 , 2 , 3 ]. Therefore, it is important to develop a new therapeutic approach to accelerate the healing and/or improve the strength of tendon.</li><li>There are several growth factors involved in the healing process. Insulin-like growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, transforming growth factor-β, basic fibroblast growth factor and vascular endothelial growth factor are among those mostly mentioned [ 4 , 5 ]. In addition, growth hormone, an anabolic peptide secreted from the anterior pituitary, can also promote tissue regeneration and cell proliferation, especially for the growth of skeletal muscle and bone [ 6 , 7 ]. Growth hormone can also increase the secretion of collagens in different kinds of cultured cells [ 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 ]. Through the binding with growth hormone receptor on the cell membrane, the action of growth hormone is mediated directly by the activation of tyrosine kinase or indirectly by induction of insulin-like growth factor [ 12 ].</li><li>BPC 157 is a pentadecapeptide containing partial sequence of the body protection compound (BPC) isolated from the human gastric juice [ 13 ]. It is stable and resistant to hydrolysis or digestion by enzymes. Previous studies have demonstrated the promoting effect of BPC 157 on the healing of different tissues, including skin, mucosa, cornea, muscle, tendon, ligament and bone in animal studies [ 14 , 15 , 16 , 17 , 18 , 19 , 20 , 21 , 22 , 23 , 24 ]. The mechanism by which pentadecapeptide BPC 157 accelerates healing is not clearly understood. It has been suggested to include up-regulation of growth factors [ 25 ], proangiogenic effect [ 26 , 27 ], and modulation of nitric oxide (NO) synthesis. BPC 157 may also control functions of collagen fragments that are associated with bone morphogenic proteins. However, none of these functions have been proved experimentally in tendon.</li><li>The present study attempted to elucidate the potential mechanism by which BPC 157 works on tendon fibroblasts to improve the tendon healing. From our previous study by cDNA microarray, the expression of growth hormone receptor gene was one of the most up-regulated in tendon fibroblasts treated with BPC 157. We therefore focused this study on the effect of BPC 157 on this gene.</li><li># 2. Results</li><li># 2.1. BPC 157 Induced the Expression of Growth Hormone Receptor in Tendon Fibroblasts</li><li>In order to find out the potential mechanism by which BPC 157 improves the healing of tendon, we performed a cDNA microarray in a previous study and the expression of growth hormone receptor gene was one of the most up-regulated in tendon fibroblasts treated with BPC 157 ( Table 1 ).</li><li>Genes up-regulated in tendon fibroblasts by BPC 157.</li><li>To further confirm this result, we treated tendon fibroblasts with BPC 157 at different concentrations (0, 0.1, 0.25 and 0.5 μg/mL) for 24 h and the expression of growth hormone receptor was found to increase in a dose-dependent manner ( Figure 1 A,C). More interestingly, BPC 157, at the concentration of 0.5 μg/mL, significantly induced the expression of growth hormone receptor in tendon fibroblasts time-dependently from day one to day three ( Figure 1 B,D). Both the RNA and protein levels were determined by RT/real-time PCR ( Figure 1 A,B) and Western blotting ( Figure 1 C,D), respectively. Up to sevenfold increases could be observed at day three.</li><li>BPC 157 increased the expression of growth hormone receptor in tendon fibroblasts. Tendon fibroblasts at 50%–60% confluency were treated with BPC 157 at concentrations of 0, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5 μg/mL for 24 h ( A and C ) or 0.5 μg/mL for one to three days ( B and D ). The mRNA ( A and B ) and protein ( C and D ) expressions of growth hormone receptor were measured by RT/real-time PCR and Western blot analysis, respectively. Experiments were done in triplicate.</li><li># 2.2. Growth Hormone Increased the Cell Proliferation of BPC 157-Treated Tendon Fibroblasts</li><li>Since growth hormone receptor, after the binding of growth hormone, can trigger the activation of signal pathway and eventually lead to the increase of cell proliferation [ 28 ]. We, therefore, tested the effect of adding growth hormone to BPC 157-treated tendon fibroblasts. Tendon fibroblasts were treated with BPC 157 at different concentrations (0, 0.1, 0.25 and 0.5 μg/mL) for first 24 h and 0.1 μg/mL growth hormone was added for another 24 h and cell viability was determined by MTT assay. Results in Figure 2 A demonstrated a dose-dependent increase of viable cells after the addition of growth hormone. Similarly, the number of viable cells after the addition of 0.1 μg/mL growth hormone to BPC 157-treated cells for one to three days significantly increased in a time-dependent manner ( Figure 2 B), proving that BPC 157 pretreatment could potentiate the effect of growth hormone on increasing the number of viable cells. To further demonstrate the effect of BPC 157 and growth hormone on the cell proliferation of tendon fibroblasts, we analyzed the expression of cell proliferation marker, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) in tendon fibroblasts at the RNA expression level by RT/real-time PCR. Results in Figure 3 A,B revealed a similar pattern of PCNA induction in tendon fibroblasts by BPC 157 and growth hormone that was correlated very well with the increase of viable cell number.</li><li>Growth hormone increased the cell number of BPC 157-treated tendon fibroblasts. Tendon fibroblasts at 50%–60% confluency were pretreated with BPC 157 at concentrations of 0, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5 μg/mL for 24 h ( A ) or 0.5 μg/mL for one to three days ( B ). After BPC 157 pretreatment, 0.1 μg/mL growth hormone was added for another 24 h and then MTT assay was performed. Experiments were done in triplicate. The “★” would be applied if there is statistically significant.</li><li>Growth hormone increased the PCNA gene expression in BPC 157-treated tendon fibroblasts. Tendon fibroblasts at 50%–60% confluency were pretreated with BPC 157 at concentrations of 0, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5 μg/mL for 24 h ( A ) or 0.5 μg/mL for one to three days ( B ). After BPC 157 pretreatment, 0.1 μg/mL growth hormone was added for another 24 h and then the PCNA gene expression was analyzed by RT/real-time PCR. Experiments were done in triplicate. The “★” would be applied if there is statistically significant.</li><li># 2.3. Growth Hormone Activated the Janus Kinase 2 Gene (Jak2) in BPC 157-Treated Tendon Fibroblasts</li><li>Through the JAK-STAT signaling pathway, growth hormone can exert the growth-stimulating effects on different tissues. Therefore, we investigated the effect of growth hormone on the activation of Jak2 in BPC 157-treated tendon fibroblasts. As shown in Figure 4 , the addition of 1 μg/mL growth hormone did activate Jak2 signal pathway in tendon fibroblasts pretreated with 0.5 μg/mL BPC 157. Longer treatment with BPC 157, the level of phosphorylated but not the total amount of Jak2 was found to be higher by the stimulation with growth hormone.</li><li>Growth hormone activated more JAK2 proteins in BPC 157-treated tendon fibroblasts. Tendon fibroblasts at 50%–60% confluency were pretreated with BPC 157 at concentration of 0.5 μg/mL for one to three days. After BPC 157 pretreatment, 0.1 μg/mL growth hormone was added for another 24 h and then total JAK2 (which was not shown) and activation of JAK2 which was determined by the level of phosphorylated JAK2 were detected by Western blot analysis ( A ). Experiments were done in triplicate. The levels of phosphorylated JAK2 were calculated by direct densitomeric analysis of the blot ( B ). The “★” would be applied if there is statistically significant.</li><li># 3. Discussion</li><li>Body protection compound (BPC, M.W. 40,000) was first discovered and isolated in human gastric juice and later a stable 15 amino acid fragment (Gly Glu Pro Pro Pro Gly Lys Pro Ala Asp Asp Ala Gly Leu Val, M.W. 1419, called BPC 157) with apparently no sequence homology to other known peptides, was found to be essential for BPC’s activity [ 23 ]. Although the detailed mechanism is poorly understood, BPC 157 appears to be beneficial to almost all organ systems in many species when very low dosages (mostly ng/kg to μg/kg range) after ip, ig, and intramucosal (local) application are used and no side effect or toxicity is found. Except the effects on various gastrointestinal lesions, the healing effects of BPC 157 have also been reported on pancreas, liver injuries, endothelium, heart damage and pseudoarthrosis. Interestingly, the healing of transected rat Achilles tendon could be accelerated by BPC 157 and even the early functional recovery of tendon to bone after Achilles detachment was found to be promoted by BPC 157 [ 19 ].</li><li>Our previous study has shown that BPC 157 actually has no direct effect on promoting the proliferation or the expression of PCNA gene in tendon fibroblasts, although it enhances the migratory ability of tendon fibroblasts [ 29 ]. The healing of the injured tendon involves a lot of complex pathways. It progresses through overlapping stages of inflammation, regeneration and remodeling. The process of regeneration is believed to occur either extrinsically by infiltration of external cells, intrinsically by tendon fibroblast proliferation, or both. Migration and proliferation of cells seem to be fundamental for tendon healing. If BPC 157 does not directly promote the proliferation of tendon fibroblasts, what could be the potential mechanism underlying its healing effect? We therefore screened the effect of BPC 157 on tendon fibroblasts by cDNA microarray analysis in our previous study. Several genes were up-regulated by BPC 157 and growth hormone receptor is one of the top five ( Table 1 ).</li><li>The present study, for the first time, demonstrated that the expressions of growth hormone receptor at both the mRNA and protein levels in tendon fibroblasts were increased by BPC 157. The promoting effect of BPC 157 on the expression of growth hormone receptor was further found to be more significant up to three days after the treatment. In combination with the addition of growth hormone, the proliferation and the PCNA expression of tendon fibroblasts were both enhanced in tendon fibroblasts. The addition of growth hormone was confirmed to activate the phosphorylation but not the total amount of JAK2, the downstream signal pathway of growth hormone receptor, to a more significant level in tendon fibroblasts with longer treatment with BPC 157, providing a new potential mechanism for the healing effect of BPC 157.</li><li>Growth hormone is a peptide hormone that stimulates growth, cell reproduction and regeneration of chondrocytes and osteoblasts in humans and other animals [ 30 ]. Growth hormone is used as a prescription drug in medicine to treat children’s growth disorders and adult growth hormone deficiency. It is known to be capable of increasing the protein production and muscle mass [ 12 ]. Growth hormone can also increase matrix collage synthesis in human skeletal muscles and tendons. After binding with the surface receptor on target cells, growth hormone can activate the JAK-STAT signaling pathway and stimulate the production of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), which is known to exert a growth-stimulating effect on different tissues. Interestingly, a recent study showed that the strength of the lower part of healthy men has also been increased by growth hormone therapy and a clinical trial is now undergoing for older population. Growth hormone was also reported to have effects of migration and adhesion of different cells. Taub et al. reported that through chemokinetic effect, growth hormone could significantly induce the migration of resting and activated human T cells [ 31 ]. Savino also reported that growth hormone has a role in migration of developing thymocytes [ 32 ]. Lee et al. reported that through IGF-1, growth hormone might activate fibroblast proliferation and keratinocyte migration [ 33 ]. These effects all contribute to the process of tendon healing.</li><li>Our results showed that, in the presence of same amount of growth hormone, pretreatment with BPC 157 can no doubt enhance the effect of growth hormone in a dose- and time-dependent manner. More importantly, the effect of BPC 157 can last for at least three days in the cultured tendon fibroblasts, confirming the stability of this pentadecapeptide and only low dose is required for sustained effect. However, we understood that the experimental condition using in vitro culture of tendon fibroblasts could not mimic the real environment of tendon. During in vivo healing course, other cells, such as leukocytes and stem cells, may also interact with each other and contribute to this complicated process. It is possible that the healing accelerating effect of BPC 157 may act on other cells and exert an indirect effect on promoting the proliferation of tendon fibroblasts.</li><li># 4. Experimental Section</li><li># 4.1. Primary Culture of Tendon Fibroblasts from Rat</li><li>This study has been approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee before the procedures were performed. Male Sprague-Dawley rats, weighing 200 to 250 gm, were used as the source of tendon fibroblasts in this study. Achilles tendons were first harvested from rats by aseptic procedures. Each tendon was chopped into pieces at size about 1.5 to 2.0 mm 3 and separately put into six-well culture plates. Then 3 mL culture medium made of Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium with 10% FBS, 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 mg/mL streptomycin was added to each well and maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO 2 . After migrating out from the explants, tendon fibroblasts started to grow rapidly. After reaching confluency, the cells were subcultured by trypsinization at a 1:3 dilution ratio. Tendon fibroblasts between passages 2 and 4, having proper growth rate and normal fibroblast shape, were used in the following experiments. Each experiment was repeated three times using tendon fibroblasts isolated from a different rat.</li><li># 4.2. BPC 157 Treatment</li><li>Pentadecapeptide BPC 157 (GEPPPGKPADDAGLV, M.W. 1419) was synthesized and purchased from Kelowna International Scientific Inc., Taipei, Taiwan. BPC 157 was added to cells at the concentrations of 0 (control group), 0.1, 0.25 and 0.5 μg/mL. After incubation at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO 2 /95% air for 1, 2 and 3 days, cells were collected for analysis of the expression of growth hormone receptors by RT PCR and Western blotting.</li><li># 4.3. Real-Time PCR</li><li>Total RNA was extracted from cells by acid guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform extraction method, and complementary (c)DNA was synthesized using 1 μg total RNA in a 20 μL RT reaction mix containing 0.5 μg/μL of random primers, 0.1 mM dNTP, 0.1 M DTT and 5× first strand buffer. Real-time PCR was performed using an SYBR Green I technology and MxPro- Mx3000P QPCR machine (Stratagene, CA, USA), and a master mix was prepared with Smart Quant Green Master Mix with dUTP & ROX Kit (Protech, Taipei, Taiwan). Relative gene expressions between experimental groups were determined using MxPro software (Stratagene, CA, USA) and GAPDH was used as an internal control. All real-time PCRs were performed in triplicate, and changes in gene expressions were reported as multiples of increases relative to the controls. The following primers were used: GAPDH: 5'-GAGGGGCCATCCACAGTCTT-3' (forward) and 5'-TTCATTGACCTCAACTACAT-3' (reverse), GHR: 5'-GATGTTCTGAAGGGATGG-3' (forward) and 5'-GTGGGACTGATGTTGACC-3' (reverse) and PCNA: 5'-GAAGCACCAAATCAAGAG-3' (forward) and 5'-CATCTCCAATATGGCTAA-3' (reverse).</li><li># 4.4. Western Blot Analysis</li><li>Cell extracts were prepared in lysis buffer containing Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 2 mM DTT, 2 mM PMSF and 1% Triton X-100 followed by ultrasonication method. Protein concentration of the cell extracts was determined by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories, CA, USA). Samples with same amount of proteins were then separated by 12% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred onto a PVDF membrane. Membrane was incubated at room temperature in blocking solution (1% bovine serum albumin, 1% goat serum in 1×PBS) for 1 h, followed by incubation in blocking solution containing appropriate dilution of primary antibody for growth hormone receptor (R&D System, MN, USA) or phospho-Jak2 (Tyr1007/1008, Cell Signaling Technology, Inc. Beverly, MA, USA) for two hours. After washed three times in 1×PBS, the membrane was then incubated in 1×PBS containing goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) for 1 h. Membranes were washed three times in 1×PBS and positive signals were developed with enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Amershan Pharmacia Biotech, Little Chalfont Buckinghamshire, England).</li><li># 4.5. MTT Assay</li><li>1 × 10 5 tendon fibroblasts were seeded in each well of 24-well culture plate, which contained culture medium made of 0.5 mL of DMEM, 10% FBS, 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 mg/mL streptomycin in each well. BPC 157 was added into each well at the concentration of 0 (control group), 0.1, 0.25 and 0.5 μg/mL for 1, 2, and 3 days at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO 2 /95% air. One day after the addition of growth hormone to the BPC 157-treated tendon fibroblasts, cells were washed once with 1xPBS, followed by adding 1 mL DMEM containing 0.05 mg/mL 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT). After incubation at 37 °C for 1 h, the media were removed and formazan crystals in the cells were dissolved in 1 mL DMSO and processed for OD reading at 570 nm using a spectrophotometer. The experiments were performed in triplicate.</li><li># 4.6. Statistical Analysis</li><li>All data were expressed as mean ± SEM. Quantification of phosphorylated Jak2 and tubulin expressions were performed by calculating the band density using 1D Digital Analysis Software (Kodak Digital ScienceTM, Eastman Kodak Company, Rochester, NY, USA). Comparisons between control group and experimental group were performed using Student’s t test. The level of statistical significance was set at a p value of 0.05. The “★” would be applied if there is statistically significant.</li><li># 5. Conclusions</li><li>This study demonstrated the promoting effect of BPC 157 on tissue healing is potentially associated with the increased expression of growth hormone receptor in tendon fibroblasts. This finding also suggests a different way to promote the tissue healing by increasing the expression of growth hormone receptor to promote the beneficial effect of growth hormone in terms of enhanced proliferation. In addition, the amount of growth hormone used can theoretically be reduced and also the cost of therapy. BPC 157 may play an important role in promoting tendon healing and potential clinical usage in the future is expected.</li><li># Acknowledgments</li><li>The authors would like to thank National Science Council of Taiwan and Chang Gung Memorial Hospital for supporting this work.
