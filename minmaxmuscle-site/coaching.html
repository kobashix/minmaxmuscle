    <h1>Coaching</h1>

    <p>
      Coaching at MinMaxMuscle is built around structure, accountability, and
      intelligent progression. This is not generic programming, influencer
      workouts, or short-term motivation cycles.
    </p>

    <p>
      Every coaching engagement is designed to align training, nutrition, and
      recovery with clearly defined goals—whether that is fat loss, hypertrophy,
      performance, or long-term sustainability.
    </p>

    <h2>Who Coaching Is For</h2>
    <p>
      Coaching is intended for individuals who want clarity, structure, and
      measurable progress. This includes:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Individuals cutting fat while maintaining strength and muscle</li>
      <li>Lifters stalled due to poor recovery or excessive volume</li>
      <li>Busy professionals who need efficient, repeatable systems</li>
      <li>Experienced trainees seeking refinement rather than reinvention</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      This is not designed for beginners looking for shortcuts or people
      unwilling to follow a system consistently.
    </p>

    <h2>Coaching Philosophy</h2>
    <p>
      Progress is not accidental. It comes from managing inputs over time.
      Coaching focuses on:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Load management and recovery-aware programming</li>
      <li>Clear priorities within each training phase</li>
      <li>Nutrition frameworks that support training outcomes</li>
      <li>Feedback-driven adjustments based on real data, not guesswork</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The goal is not maximal suffering. The goal is repeatable progress that
      compounds.
    </p>

    <h2>What Coaching Includes</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Customized training structure aligned to goals and schedule</li>
      <li>Nutrition guidance based on macros, timing, and adherence</li>
      <li>Ongoing adjustments as recovery, performance, and body composition change</li>
      <li>Clear rules for intensity, volume, and progression</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Coaching is collaborative but decisive. Adjustments are made with intent,
      not experimentation for its own sake.
    </p>

    <h2>Next Steps</h2>
    <p>
      Coaching availability is limited to ensure quality and responsiveness.

    </p>

    <p>
      No automated sales funnels. No pressure. If the fit is right, we proceed.
