      <h2>Nutrition Built to Support Training</h2>
      <p>
        This nutrition framework is designed to support high-output training,
        preserve lean mass, and drive consistent fat loss through structured,
        repeatable execution. It prioritizes performance, recovery, and long-term
        adherence over extreme dietary restriction.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Macronutrients -->
    <section>
      <h3>Macronutrient Structure</h3>
      <p>
        The program follows a <strong>1 : 1 : 0.5 ratio of protein, carbohydrates,
        and fats</strong>. This structure balances performance needs with caloric
        control during a cutting phase.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Protein:</strong> Prioritized to preserve lean muscle mass
          during caloric restriction.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Carbohydrates:</strong> Included to sustain training intensity,
          recovery, and overall output.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Fats:</strong> Moderated to manage total caloric intake while
          maintaining satiety.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- Calories -->
    <section>
      <h3>Caloric Intake</h3>
      <p>
        The system operates within an approximate
        <strong>500-calorie daily deficit</strong>. This range is intentional and
        conservative, allowing fat loss to occur without significantly impairing
        strength, recovery, or training quality.
      </p>

      <p class="muted">
        Aggressive deficits are avoided to reduce burnout, preserve muscle, and
        maintain consistency over time.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Timing -->
    <section>
      <h3>Nutrient Timing</h3>
      <p>
        Macronutrient distribution is adjusted throughout the day based on
        physiological demand rather than rigid meal rules.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Post-workout meals emphasize carbohydrates</strong> to support
          glycogen replenishment and recovery.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Evening meals emphasize fats</strong> to improve satiety and
          adherence during a caloric deficit.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p class="muted">
        Timing enhances the system but does not replace total caloric control.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Principles -->
    <section>
      <h3>Guiding Principles</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Nutrition exists to support training, not compete with it.</li>
        <li>Consistency and adherence outweigh short-term optimization.</li>
        <li>
          Sustainable structure is favored over extreme or trend-driven diets.
        </li>
