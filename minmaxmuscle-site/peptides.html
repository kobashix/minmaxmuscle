    <h1>Peptides With Intent</h1>
    <p>
      Peptides are not shortcuts. They are precision tools that require context,
      oversight, and disciplined execution. Education comes first, performance follows.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Education-First Framework</h2>
    <p>
      MinMaxMuscle approaches peptides through the same lens as training and nutrition:
      structured decision-making, clear objectives, and risk-aware execution.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>When Consideration Makes Sense</h2>
    <p>
      Peptides may be discussed when recovery is limiting progress, tissue quality needs
      support, or performance is plateauing despite optimized training, sleep, and nutrition.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Quality, Compliance, and Oversight</h2>
    <p>
      No gray-market experimentation. Any peptide conversation should involve a licensed
      medical professional who can assess suitability, monitor outcomes, and ensure compliance
      with local regulations.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Monitoring and Feedback</h2>
    <p>
      Metrics guide decisions. Objective markers (performance, recovery, labs, and side effects)
      determine whether an approach is worth continuing, adjusting, or stopping.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Clarity on Intent</h2>
    <p>
      The goal is not maximal intervention. The goal is a sustainable system that supports
      training outcomes and long-term health.
    </p>
